/*
TO DO:
0. make enemies in their own class
1. Make Room Types Functional (Make all kinds of rooms)
2. Finish Map (make layout)
3. Finish Combat Loop
4. Create Map
5. Fill out room types
6. Make enemies for rooms
7. Finalize rooms
8. Make menu driver
9. finalize and test

// enemy types are INT so to call them i.e. call enemy:1,2,3

//roomType controls whether room will be noncombat or combat, with number thresholds indicating enemy type I.E 0-1 is non-combat, anything higher determines type of enemy


// nextRoom is the default if there is only one way to go.
// if there are two ways to go

//Navigation menu will read the values of nextRight and nextLeft and if either one is null, then menu will simply have a next-room option, otherwise present a choice
